        <h1>The California Housing Market</h1>
        <h2><i>Exploring Economic, Geographic, and Climate Influences</i></h2>

        <br>
        <h3>OVERALL INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>
            California's housing market is among the most expensive and volatile in the U.S., driven by economic, demographic,
             and geographic factors. Rising demand and limited supply have made affordability a growing concern for residents 
             and policymakers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Climate change, particularly wildfires, has further disrupted the market, displacing residents and reshaping housing
             trends. High-risk fire zones see declining demand, while safer areas experience price surges. Ocean proximity 
             remains a key factor, with coastal properties commanding premiums.
        </p>
        <p>
            This study analyzes 10,000 housing records to explore how income, population density, housing characteristics, and 
            environmental risks impact prices. Using statistical and visual analysis, we aim to uncover regional disparities 
            and trends that inform housing policies and investment decisions.

        <h3>INTRODUCTION TO THE DATA</h3>
        <p>
            The dataset we chose to use for this project is California Housing Prices, available on 
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices">Kaggle</a>. 
            This data contains information from the California census in 1990. There are over 20.6k data 
            points in this dataset, meaning that we will only take a subset of the data (10k points) for 
            our use.
        </p>
        <p>
            The variables in this dataset are longitude and latitude (spatial, indicating the 
            geographic location of a block), housing median age (quantitative, median age of a house 
            within a block), total rooms and total bedrooms (quantitative, number of rooms/bedrooms 
            within a block), population (quantitative, total number of people residing within a block), 
            households (quantitative, groups of people residing within a home unit in a block), 
            median income (quantitative), median house value (quantitative), and ocean proximity (categorical).
            Additionally, county-level data was used for the interactive map visualizations and was 
            downloaded from 
            <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-2-counties/">

        <h3>D3 SCATTER PLOT: INTERACTIVE HOUSING PRICES BY LOCATION</h3>
        <div class="text">
              <p>
                  The D3 scatter plot shows housing prices across California based on location. Each dot represents a home, 
                  positioned using its longitude on the X-axis and latitude on the Y-axis — just like a real map. Color 
                  indicates the home’s value, with brighter points showing higher prices. Most expensive homes cluster 
                  along the coast, especially in cities like San Francisco, LA, and San Diego. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  The chart is interactive: when you hover over a point, it shows the exact price and location. D3 loads 
                  the data from a CSV file, maps it with coordinate scales, and colors it using a gradient. This makes 
                  it easy to explore patterns and see how geography affects real estate.

        <h3>CORRELATION HEATMAP: INCOME, AGE, POPULATION VS HOUSE VALUE</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                The heatmap shows the relationship between key housing variables. The strongest positive correlation 
                is between median income and median house value at +0.69, meaning that higher-income areas tend to 
                have more expensive homes. In contrast, housing median age and population have much weaker or slightly 
                negative correlations with house value, suggesting they play a less significant role in determining price. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The chart was created using Seaborn with a coolwarm color palette, where warm colors like red represent
                strong positive correlations and cool colors like blue indicate negative correlations. Labeled values 
                and color contrast make it easy to spot patterns and compare how strongly different variables are 
                related to housing prices.

        <h3>INTERACTIVE SCATTER PLOT AND BOX PLOT: OCEAN PROXIMITY</h3>
        <div class="center">
            <iframe src="scatter.html" width="70%" height="415px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

        <div class="text">
            <p>
                This scatterplot shows the relationship between a household's median income and the median
                value of the house, grouped by the house's proximity to the ocean. In general, homes with
                higher prices tend to be located closer to the ocean. Similarly, homes that were located
                inland were correlated with a lower median household income, further indicating that these
                locations were more affordable compared to homes near the ocean.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Because Altair sets a default maximum number of rows of 5000, we took a random sample of 3000 
                points in our dataset. This scatter plot compares median resident income and house value, with 
                points colored by ocean proximity category. The plot has radio boxes where ocean proximity 
                categories can be selected - the selected category will be highlighted, and the others will 
                have lower opacity for easier viewing. Hovering displays the ocean proximity category, median 
                income, and median house value.

        <h3>ON OCEAN PROXIMITY</h3>

            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    These boxplots aim to show the distribution of median home values by their proximity to the
                    ocean. We can see immediately that inland homes had the lowest distribution and several outliers,
                    meaning that prices did stretch upwards but were not found as frequent as homes in other areas. We
                    can then see that homes near the ocean and those near the bay both had very similar distributions.
                    Unlike the other categories, island homes had a very constrited range, revealing more consistent
                    home pricing trends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Utilizing several boxplots like this allows individuals to easily view and compare data across 
                    many different categories. On hover, the chart will display more advanced statistics for each plot,
                    giving insight into the category's maximum, minimum, range, quartiles, and median.

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>
            Through this visualization analysis, we aimed to explore housing records in California to discover how 
            factors such as income, population density, location, and home features affected the prices of homes. In 
            all, we discovered that elements such as proximity to the ocean and a household's median income had the 
            largest relationship with the home's price.
        </p>
        <p>
            To further explore this topic, we could continue analyzing environmental factors that 
            influence housing prices, such as a region's vulnerability to extreme temperatures, or shift our focus to 
            social factors, such as access to healthcare, safety and crime ratings, and walkability.
