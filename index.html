        <h1>The California Housing Market</h1>
        <h2><i>Exploring Economic, Geographic, and Climate Influences</i></h2>

        <br>
        <h3>OVERALL INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>
            California's housing market is among the most expensive and volatile in the U.S., driven by economic, demographic,
             and geographic factors. Rising demand and limited supply have made affordability a growing concern for residents 
             and policymakers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Climate change, particularly wildfires, has further disrupted the market, displacing residents and reshaping housing
             trends. High-risk fire zones see declining demand, while safer areas experience price surges. Ocean proximity 
             remains a key factor, with coastal properties commanding premiums.
        </p>
        <p>
            This study analyzes 10,000 housing records to explore how income, population density, housing characteristics, and 
            environmental risks impact prices. Using statistical and visual analysis, we aim to uncover regional disparities 
            and trends that inform housing policies and investment decisions.

        <h3>INTRODUCTION TO THE DATA</h3>
        <p>
            The dataset we chose to use for this project is California Housing Prices, available on 
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices">Kaggle</a>. 
            This data contains information from the California census in 1990. There are over 20.6k data 
            points in this dataset, meaning that we will only take a subset of the data (10k points) for 
            our use.
        </p>
        <p>
            The variables in this dataset are longitude and latitude (spatial, indicating the 
            geographic location of a block), housing median age (quantitative, median age of a house 
            within a block), total rooms and total bedrooms (quantitative, number of rooms/bedrooms 
            within a block), population (quantitative, total number of people residing within a block), 
            households (quantitative, groups of people residing within a home unit in a block), 
            median income (quantitative), median house value (quantitative), and ocean proximity (categorical).
            Additionally, county-level data was used for the interactive map visualizations and was 
            downloaded from 
            <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-2-counties/">
                Natural Earth</a>.

        <h3>CHOROPLETH MAP OF MEDIAN HOME PRICE</h3>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    This interactive map displays median housing prices by county. Visually, we can see that 
                    the higher housing prices are concentrated near the coastline, which supports the idea 
                    that ocean proximity is a strong factor in housing prices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To create this visualization, we combined our housing data, which contained longitude and 
                    latitude points, and county-level data for California. Initially, we had created a spatial 
                    plot with marks for each of the data points, and an on-click display of median house value. 
                    This was ultimately an ineffective way of communicating our data, since there was such a 
                    high density and range of points in urban areas like the Bay Area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To fix this problem, we instead chose to color code counties by their median housing price. 
                    Hovering displays the county name, and the median housing price and income is displayed on 
                    click. Additionally, given that this is a map, there is an implicit understanding of 
                    the proximity to the ocean.

                This scatterplot shows the relationship between a household's median income and the median
                value of the house, grouped by the house's proximity to the ocean. In general, homes with
                higher prices tend to be located closer to the ocean. Similarly, homes that were located
                inland were correlated with a lower median household income, further indicating that these
                locations were more affordable compared to homes near the ocean.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Because Altair sets a default maximum number of rows of 5000, we took a random sample of 3000 
                points in our dataset. This scatter plot compares median resident income and house value, with 
                points colored by ocean proximity category. The plot has radio boxes where ocean proximity 
                categories can be selected - the selected category will be highlighted, and the others will 
                have lower opacity for easier viewing. Hovering displays the ocean proximity category, median 
                income, and median house value.

                <p>
                    These boxplots aim to show the distribution of median home values by their proximity to the
                    ocean. We can see immediately that inland homes had the lowest distribution and several outliers,
                    meaning that prices did stretch upwards but were not found as frequent as homes in other areas. We
                    can then see that homes near the ocean and those near the bay both had very similar distributions.
                    Unlike the other categories, island homes had a very constrited range, revealing more consistent
                    home pricing trends.

                <p>
                    Utilizing several boxplots like this allows individuals to easily view and compare data across 
                    many different categories. On hover, the chart will display more advanced statistics for each plot,
                    giving insight into the category's maximum, minimum, range, quartiles, and median.

        <h3>Correlation Heatmap: Income, Age, Population vs House Value</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                The heatmap visualization reveals that median income has the strongest positive correlation (+0.69) 
                with median house value among the variables analyzed. This indicates that higher-income areas 
                generally have higher housing prices in California. On the other hand, housing median age and population
                exhibit much weaker relationships to house value, with correlations near zero or slightly negative. These 
                findings suggest that while newer or older homes and population size may have some impact, income levels 
                are a far more influential factor in determining housing prices. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The design of the heatmap, created using Seaborn, incorporates a coolwarm color palette and clearly
                labeled values to highlight both positive and negative relationships. This layout allows viewers to 
                quickly identify trends and compare the strength of associations between multiple variables in one glance.

        <h3>Geographic Scatter Plot: Housing Prices by Location</h3>
        <div class="text">
              <p>
                    The scatter plot visualizes the geographic distribution of housing prices across California
                  using latitude and longitude coordinates from the dataset. Each point represents a housing unit, 
                  with color intensity reflecting its median house value. From this visualization, it is clear 
                  that the most expensive housing is concentrated along the coastâ€”particularly around urban centers 
                  like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego.
                  In contrast, inland and rural areas exhibit significantly lower house values, highlighting the 
                  strong influence of geographic location on real estate pricing.
              </p>
              <p>
                    The use of the <code>viridis</code> color scale allows for intuitive comparison of price levels, 
                  while the small, semi-transparent data points help reveal regional clusters without overcrowding 
                  the map. This spatial analysis emphasizes how proximity to economic hubs and coastal amenities 
                  contributes to Californiaâ€™s housing market disparities.

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>
            Through this visualization analysis, we aimed to explore housing records in California to discover how 
            factors such as income, population density, location, and home features affected the prices of homes. In 
            all, we discovered that elements such as proximity to the ocean and a household's median income had the 
            largest relationship with the home's price.
