Design Choices

Choropleth Map:
To create this visualization, we combined our housing data, which contained longitude and latitude points, 
and county-level data for California. Initially, we had created a spatial plot with marks for each of the 
data points, and an on-click display of median house value. While being able to see precise locations was 
insightful, this was ultimately an ineffective way of summarizing our data, since there was such a high 
density and range of points in urban areas like the Bay Area.
To fix this problem, we instead chose to color code counties by their median housing price. Hovering 
displays the county name, and the median housing price and income is displayed on click. Additionally, 
given that this is a map, there is an implicit understanding of the proximity to the ocean.

D3 Interactive Map:
The D3 scatter plot shows housing prices across California based on location. Each dot represents 
a home, positioned using its longitude on the X-axis and latitude on the Y-axis â€” just like a 
real map. Color indicates the home's value, with brighter points showing higher prices. Most 
expensive homes cluster along the coast, especially in cities like San Francisco, LA, and San Diego.
The chart is interactive: when you hover over a point, it shows the exact price and location. 
D3 loads the data from a CSV file, maps it with coordinate scales, and colors it using a gradient. 
This makes it easy to explore patterns and see how geography affects real estate.

Correlation Heatmap:
The chart was created using Seaborn with a coolwarm color palette, where warm colors like red 
represent strong positive correlations and cool colors like blue indicate negative correlations. 
Labeled values and color contrast make it easy to spot patterns and compare how strongly different 
variables are related to housing prices.

Ocean Proximity Scatterplot:
Because Altair sets a default maximum number of rows of 5000, we took a random sample of 3000 
points in our dataset. This scatter plot compares median resident income and house value, with 
points colored by ocean proximity category. The plot has radio boxes where ocean proximity 
categories can be selected - the selected category will be highlighted, and the others will 
have lower opacity for easier viewing. Hovering displays the ocean proximity category, 
median income, and median house value.

Ocean Proximity Boxplots:
Utilizing several boxplots like this allows individuals to easily view and compare data 
across many different categories. On hover, the chart will display more advanced statistics 
for each plot, giving insight into the category's maximum, minimum, range, quartiles, and median.
